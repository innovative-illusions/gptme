Getting Started
===============

This guide will help you get started with gptme.

Installation
------------

To install gptme, we recommend using ``pipx`` or ``uv``:

.. code-block:: bash

    pipx install gptme
    # or
    uv tool install gptme

If pipx is not installed, you can install it using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --user pipx

If ``uv`` is not installed, you can install it using pip, pipx, or your system package manager.

.. note::

   Windows is not directly supported, but you can run gptme using WSL or Docker.

Usage
-----

To start your first chat, simply run:

.. code-block:: bash

    gptme

This will start an interactive chat session with the AI assistant.

If you haven't set a :doc:`LLM provider <providers>` API key in the environment or :doc:`configuration <config>`, you will be prompted for one which will be saved in the configuration file.

For detailed usage instructions, see :doc:`usage`.

You can also try the :doc:`examples`.
